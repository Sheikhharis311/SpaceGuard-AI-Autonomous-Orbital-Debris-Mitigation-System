### 🛰️ 2. NASA Data Integration
Seamlessly fetches and processes **live orbital debris data** using Two-Line Element (TLE) sets from CelesTrak:
```python
# Real TLE data ingestion from CELESTRAK
def load_debris_from_tle():
    response = requests.get("https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/active.txt")
    # Parses >200 real orbital objects
